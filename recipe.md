In a blender add milk,cream,sugar and chopped strawberrys or strawberry isense.
Blend everything to a smooth mixture.
Pour in a container.Cover and keep in the freezer for the ice cream to set.
When the icecream is almost set ,break into parts with a knife and add in the blender jar.You can see the ice crystals and we need to get rid of this.
Blend till the whole mixture is smooth and slightly doubled up.Ypu can see the texture of the ice cream.Pour back in the same container and keep in the freezer for the ice cream to set.
When fully set.Scoop out and serve strawberry ice cream plain or topped with your favourite sauce.
